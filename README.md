# singleton
The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and ensures that this instance can be easily accessed globally.

In other words, the Singleton pattern guarantees that there is only one instance of a class, and provides a way to access that instance throughout the codebase.
